{"name":"Iterated Function Systems","tagline":"15-662 Graphics Project 5 Proposal","body":"**Team: Ganesh Nunnagopala (gnunnago), Archit Karandikar (akarandi)**\r\n\r\nIn this project, we will extend the code for the 15-662 rasterization project (p1) to rasterize fractal patterns using **Iterated Function Systems**.\r\n\r\nIterated Function Systems start with a seed point and specify a Probability Distribution Function over affine transformations. In every iteration. the point is plotted and transformed according to the specified distribution.\r\n\r\nWe plan on attaining the following milestones for the project:\r\n* Modify the p1 code to implement the IFS for the Sierpensky Traingle. Rasterize the image.\r\n* Implement the IFS for the Barnsley Fern. Rasterize the image.\r\n3. Formalize a IFS-specification file format and implement the corresponding parser which renders a specified IFS.\r\n4. Modify the rendering procedure using an energy buffer and plot normalized irradiances.\r\n5. Render the background so that intensity falls off with increasing distance from the fractal.\r\n6. Replace the chaos game implementation with an implementation of the fractal frame algorithm.to implement log-density dsiplay rendering and coloured fractals.  \r\n\r\nThe following additional milestones will be attained subject to time constraints:\r\n* Create and render some IFSs which use the features mentioned above.\r\n8. Add support for colour specification in the IFS-specification file.\r\n9. Add key-based support for stepping through the fractal rendering process.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
